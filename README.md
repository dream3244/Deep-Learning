Annual Project Plan in Freshman Year
* Project Name: Medical-Image-Analysis-based-on-Deep-Learning
* code: see the following repository : pytorch-cifar10 & pytorch_image_classification
1. Investigate the development of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), and the theory of 4 traditional CNN models: LeNet, VGG11, VGG13, and VGG16 to get a general understanding of Deep Learning networks in image classification. 
2. Apply them to the CIFAR-10 dataset and analyze the result to put the theory into practice.
3. Read a large amount of literature to determine further research direction.
4. Explore the development and related networks of Positive Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) and Adversarial Training.
5. Investigate the theory of Predictive Adversarial Networks (PAN) based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) 
6. Perform experiments on different types of datasets and analyze the result.

Description: This project focuses on Positive Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) and Adversarial Training in medical image classification tasks. We investigate the theory of Predictive Adversarial Networks (PAN) based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and reconstruct the PAN model by proposing a new objective function based on JS divergence. Experimental results in our JS-PAN model on the Medical-MINST dataset show the effectiveness and robustness of our model.
