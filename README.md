# Deep-Learning
## Med&DL
Annual Project Plan in Freshman Year
* Project Name: Medical-Image-Analysis-based-on-Deep-Learning
* code: see the following repository : pytorch-cifar10 & pytorch_image_classification
1. Investigate the development of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), and the theory of 4 traditional CNN models: LeNet, VGG11, VGG13, and VGG16 to get a general understanding of Deep Learning networks in image classification. 
2. Apply them to the CIFAR-10 dataset and analyze the result to put the theory into practice.
3. Read a large amount of literature to determine further research direction.
4. Explore the development and related networks of Positive Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) and Adversarial Training.
5. Investigate the theory of Predictive Adversarial Networks (PAN) based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) 
6. Perform experiments on different types of datasets and analyze the result.

## PAN
Medical Image Classification based on Predictive Adversarial Networks (PAN)
Current Research Project

1. Pore over a copious amount of literature to formulating the research plan.
2. Explore the development and related networks of Positive Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) and Adversarial Training.
3. Investigate the theory of Predictive Adversarial Networks (PAN) based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and perform experiments on different types of datasets.
4. Reconstructing the Predictive Adversarial Networks by proposing a new objective function.
5. Test the PAN model on the Medical-MINST datasets, and compare it with traditional GAN models as baselines to analyze the classification result and robustness of PAN.
6. All implementations are based on Python3 and Pytorch. 




## CNN
